# A simple Jurassic Museum game made in Unity (Part of it)
A simple Jurassic museum that was implemented in Unity. Part of a project for the Human-Computer Interaction class.
The user controls the camera and can go around the rooms, reading the description of various dinosaurs of different eras. The game also features a shop that the player can virtually "buy" a replica of said dinosaurs. 

The game was designed for Human-Computer Interaction class. (Part of University of West Attica study program).

More details will be added in the future. 

For now, Scripts and Scenes are added which are part of the Assets folder. (I only added Scripts because I want the code to be visible).
